4. **Physical Touch:** Hugs, kisses, or gentle touches that create warmth and comfort.  
5. **Receiving Gifts:** Small, thoughtful items that show you care.

**Daily Focus Activity:**  
As you go about your day, think about these five ways. Notice any moments when you feel loved. Jot down a quick note if one of these actions happens.

At the end of the day, write down which two love languages made you feel the most cared for today.
