## Day 1: Discovering Your Core Values

### Today's Learning

Welcome to Day 1 of your Values & Vision journey! Today, we're exploring the foundation of a meaningful life and relationship: your core values.

Have you ever wondered why some decisions feel so right, while others leave you feeling unsettled? Or why certain conflicts with your partner seem to hit deeper than others? The answer often lies in your values—the principles and beliefs that guide your choices and define what matters most to you.

Values are like an internal compass that helps you navigate life's complexities. When you live in alignment with your values, you experience a sense of authenticity and purpose. When your actions conflict with your values, you often feel internal tension or dissatisfaction.

Here are some important insights about values in relationships:

**Values are different from preferences or interests.** You might prefer Italian food or enjoy hiking, but these aren't necessarily values. Values are deeper guiding principles like honesty, adventure, security, or creativity.

**Couples don't need identical values to thrive.** What's important is understanding each other's core values, respecting them, and finding ways to honor what matters to each of you.

**Some value differences can be complementary.** For example, if one partner values spontaneity while the other values planning, this can create a healthy balance when understood and navigated with respect.

**Values often evolve over time.** While core values tend to be relatively stable, their expression and priority might shift through different life stages and experiences.

Let's look at how values show up in everyday relationship situations:

**Values in Action: Family**

*Example:* Maya and Liam both value family, but in different ways. For Maya, family means maintaining close connections with extended relatives, calling her parents several times a week, and hosting family gatherings. For Liam, family means creating strong bonds in their immediate household and being fully present with their children.

Initially, this difference created tension—Maya felt Liam wasn't committed enough to family connections, while Liam felt Maya was too focused on extended family at the expense of their own household. Once they recognized that they both valued family but expressed it differently, they found ways to honor both expressions: Maya maintains her close extended family ties, Liam creates quality time for their immediate family, and they compromise on how often they participate in larger family events.

**Values in Action: Financial Security vs. Experience**

*Example:* Aiden values financial security and stability. He feels most comfortable with careful planning, saving, and making conservative financial choices. His partner, Elena, deeply values experiences and adventure. She believes in investing in travel, learning opportunities, and memorable moments.

This value difference could create significant conflict—with Aiden seeing Elena as irresponsible and Elena viewing Aiden as too rigid. However, by understanding these as legitimate values rather than character flaws, they created a system that honors both: they maintain a solid emergency fund and retirement savings (honoring security) while also budgeting for meaningful experiences and adventures (honoring experience). Their different perspectives actually create a healthier financial approach than either would achieve alone.

**Values in Action: Growth vs. Stability**

*Example:* Kai values personal growth and continuous learning. They're always reading new books, taking courses, and pushing themselves to evolve. Their partner, Olivia, values stability and consistency. She finds comfort in routines and traditions, and feels most secure when life is predictable.

Rather than seeing these values as incompatible, they've found ways to create a relationship that honors both. They maintain certain stable routines and traditions (morning coffee together, Sunday family dinners) while also building in space for growth and new experiences. Kai has learned that some stability actually supports their growth, while Olivia has discovered that certain types of growth can enhance rather than threaten stability.

### Why This Matters For Your Relationship

When couples don't understand each other's core values, they often misinterpret behaviors and intentions. What one partner sees as a matter of principle, the other might view as stubbornness or overreaction.

Understanding your own and your partner's values helps you:
- Make decisions that feel right for both of you
- Navigate conflicts with greater empathy
- Support each other's authentic expression
- Build a life that feels meaningful to both of you
- Create a shared vision that honors what matters most

The beautiful thing about clarifying values is that it often reveals that what seemed like fundamental disagreements are actually different expressions of compatible values. This understanding creates more space for compromise and creative solutions.

### Today's Activity

Set aside 30 minutes to begin exploring your personal values. First, individually review this list of common values and circle or note the 10-15 that resonate most strongly with you:

Achievement, Adventure, Authenticity, Balance, Beauty, Belonging, Compassion, Contribution, Courage, Creativity, Curiosity, Determination, Fairness, Faith, Family, Freedom, Friendship, Fun, Generosity, Growth, Harmony, Health, Honesty, Humor, Independence, Innovation, Integrity, Joy, Justice, Kindness, Knowledge, Leadership, Learning, Love, Loyalty, Mindfulness, Openness, Optimism, Peace, Pleasure, Privacy, Recognition, Respect, Responsibility, Security, Self-expression, Service, Simplicity, Spirituality, Stability, Success, Tradition, Truth, Wisdom

Next, narrow your list to the 5-7 values that feel most essential to who you are. These are your core values.

Finally, share your core values with your partner and discuss:
- Why each value matters to you
- How you try to express these values in your life
- A time when honoring this value was particularly important to you

Listen with curiosity to your partner's values, especially where they differ from yours.

### Reflection Questions

1. Which of your values do you feel are most understood and supported by your partner?
2. Are there values you hold that you feel are sometimes in tension with your partner's values or preferences?
3. How have your core values evolved over time? Were there values that were more important to you in the past that have shifted?
4. How do you react when you feel one of your core values is being compromised?
