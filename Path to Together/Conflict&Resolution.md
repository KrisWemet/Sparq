Below is the detailed outline for the **Conflict & Resolution Journey**. This path is designed to help you and your partner work through disagreements and learn to handle conflicts in a healthy, supportive way. The journey is flexible (about 14 days is suggested, but you can take more or less time), and each day follows four simple steps: Begin, Share, Reflect, and Align. The language is simple and practical—no jargon, just clear actions that help you grow together.

### **Conflict & Resolution Journey (Approx. 14 Days)**

**Overall Goal:**  
Learn how to understand your feelings during disagreements, communicate openly about them, and create simple habits that help you solve conflicts together without hurt feelings.

---

#### **Day 1: Notice Conflict**  
- **Begin:** Think of a small disagreement or a moment when you felt frustrated recently. Write it down in your own words.  
- **Daily Focus:** As you go about your day, pay attention to any small moments of irritation or conflict, even if they seem minor.  
- **Reflect:** At the end of the day, review your notes. What common feelings or triggers do you see?  
- **Align:** Share your thoughts with your partner in a calm moment. Agree to start noticing these moments together.

---

#### **Day 2: Identify Your Triggers**  
- **Begin:** List one or two things that tend to upset you during a disagreement (for example, feeling ignored or rushed).  
- **Daily Focus:** Notice when these triggers come up today.  
- **Reflect:** Write down one incident where you felt triggered. How did it affect you?  
- **Align:** Talk with your partner about this trigger. Decide on a small change, like taking a deep breath before reacting.

---

#### **Day 3: Express Your Feelings**  
- **Begin:** Write a short note about a recent conflict, focusing on how you felt rather than what your partner did.  
- **Daily Focus:** Try to use simple phrases like “I felt…” instead of “You made me feel…” in your thoughts today.  
- **Reflect:** At day’s end, think about how expressing your feelings this way might make it easier to share.  
- **Align:** Share your note with your partner and listen to their note, if they’re ready.

---

#### **Day 4: Practice Active Listening**  
- **Begin:** Learn to listen without interrupting. Today, commit to really hearing what your partner says, without planning your response while they speak.  
- **Daily Focus:** In every conversation, try to repeat back what you heard before replying.  
- **Reflect:** At the end of the day, think about a moment when active listening helped you understand your partner better.  
- **Align:** Discuss with your partner what you both noticed, and agree to keep practicing this simple habit.

---

#### **Day 5: Share a Conflict Story**  
- **Begin:** Each partner picks one small conflict from the past week.  
- **Daily Focus:** Take time today to tell your partner the story, focusing on your own experience and feelings.  
- **Reflect:** After sharing, reflect on how hearing the story made you feel.  
- **Align:** Agree on one thing you could both do next time to help prevent a similar conflict.

#### **Day 6: Understand Each Other’s Views**  
- **Begin:** Write down what you think your partner’s perspective is during conflicts.

- **Daily Focus:** Look for moments today when a minor disagreement helped clarify an issue.  
- **Reflect:** Write down one positive outcome that came from a conflict.  
- **Align:** Share this with your partner and agree that conflicts can be opportunities for growth.

#### **Day 8: Focus on Calmness**  
- **Begin:** Decide on a simple calming strategy (like taking a deep breath or a brief walk) for moments when you feel tension rising.  
- **Daily Focus:** Use this strategy whenever you sense anger or frustration today.  
- **Reflect:** At the end of the day, write about how this helped you handle a tense moment.  
- **Align:** Share your experience and agree on using this strategy in future conflicts.

---

#### **Day 9: Set a “Time-Out” Signal**  
- **Begin:** Agree on a simple word or gesture that either of you can use when you need a moment to cool down during a conflict.  
- **Daily Focus:** Practice using this signal if a minor disagreement starts to escalate.
