Below is the detailed outline for the **Intimacy & Connection Journey**—a standalone path designed to help couples deepen both emotional and physical closeness. This journey is set over approximately 14 days (with flexibility to move faster), and each day follows four simple steps: Begin, Share, Reflect, and Align—with a Daily Focus Activity that encourages you to experience intimacy in real life.

### **Intimacy & Connection Journey (Approx. 14 Days)**

**Overall Goal:**  
Deepen your connection by exploring what intimacy means to each of you, sharing moments of closeness, reflecting on your feelings, and building daily rituals that nurture your bond.
